# Server Hardening using Powershell DSC
CIS Level 1 &amp; Azure Security Center Hardening recommendations implemented in PowerShell DSC from Azure Automation. These DSC templates are my efforts to try to implement CIS Level 1 and Azure Security Center recommendations for Server Hardening.

__These are my efforts, and my efforts only. There do not have any official status or endorsement from CIS or any other entity. No warranty provided. Please test before using!__
 I know I did. ;)
 
 We run these templates on all our virtual machines in Azure using Azure automation. The result in our environment is a score of 93% precent on CIS Microsoft Windows Server 2019 Benchmark v1.2.1.
